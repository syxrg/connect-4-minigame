Idea
-
For my final project, I would like to implement the game Connect 4. I will be achieving this by providing an interface 
for 2 different players to compete against each other. It will follow the traditional rules of Connect 4, which is 
winning via horizontal, vertical and diagonal means. The components of my game include a traditional 7x6 board, red and 
yellow game tokens, and a sign indicating which player's turn it is. 

Although I do not have particular background knowledge for this project, I am interested in creating it as I have played
Connect 4 many times. Because of this, I am confident in my understanding of the game which will allow me to correctly
implement the structure and logic. I used to play this game a lot in my childhood, so I am excited to be able to write 
code to create this project!  hi hi 

Planned Timeline
- 
* Week 1: Create the game engine and strategy, implement board set up. Test for game strategy and win/lose scenarios.  
* Week 2: Add game functionality by implement clicking of mouse to drop token into game board
* Week 3: Further add to game functionality by implementing scoreboard and player turn, play again button. Test to make 
  sure they are saved within each instance of game.   
* Week 4: Add graphics and sounds such as soundbits into gameboard responding to each players turn. (ie. when token is dropped 
  on board, imitates sound in real life. )

Stretch Goals
- 

* Add functionality to for customisation and personalisation of the game.
* For example, choosing token colour, board game colour, background colour, different sound themes
